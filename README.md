# Nitro

Quick and easy performance analyzer library for golang.

## Overview

Nitro is a quick and easy performance analyzer library for golang.
It is useful for comparing A/B against different drafts of functions
or different functions.

## Implementing Nitro

Using Nitro is simple. First use go get to install the latest version
of the library.

    $ go get github.com/spf13/nitro

Next include nitro in your application.

    import "github.com/spf13/nitro"

Somewhere near the beginning of your application (or where you want to
begin profiling) call

    timer := nitro.Initialize()

Then throughout your application wherever a major division of work is
call 

    timer.Step("name of step")

### Flags

Nitro automatically adds a flag to your application. If you aren't already
using flags in your application the following code is an example of how you
may use flags. *Make sure to import "flag"*.

    func main() {
        flag.Parse()

    }

## Usage

Once the library is implemented throughout your application simply run your
application and pass the "-stepAnalysis" flag to it. It does not need to be 
built to run, but can be called from go run or the binary form.

    $ go run ./my_application -stepAnalysis

### Example output
The following output comes from the [hugo](http://github.com/spf13/hugo) static site generator library.  Nitro was built as a component of hugo and was extracted into it's own library.

    $ ./main -p spf13 -b http://localhost -d -stepAnalysis
